1. Introduction:

Computer vision technologies have been widely used in many wild field industrial environment for safety monitoring, mechanical equipments working condition monitoring and mechanical equipment automation (autonomous excavator[1]), and haze and dust conditions commonly exists in real-world industrial environment, which heavily influence the performances of computer vision technologies, including object detection, object segmentation, etc. Current real-world captured datasets usually need the help of professional haze machines, which cannot handle all the conditions in real-world scenarios. 

To relieve the need of data captured in real-world industrial environment, we propose the IDS dataset which is captured in a more critical real-world quarry scenarios of industrial operations. 3300 real-world captured images are contained, where 3000 images are split for training and 300 images are for testing. To the best of our knowledge, the IDS dataset is the first real-world dataset that captured in real-world industrial environment, which will be public available for research uses.
