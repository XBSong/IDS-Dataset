### 1. Introduction: 

To relieve the need of data captured in real-world industrial environment, we release the IDS dataset which is captured in a more critical real-world quarry scenarios of industrial operations. 3300 real-world captured images are contained, where 3000 images are split for training and 300 images are for testing. 

### 2. Dataset:
