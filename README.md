Computer vision technologies have been widely used in many wild field industrial environment for safety monitoring, mechanical equipments working condition monitoring and mechanical equipment automation (autonomous excavator[1]), and haze and dust conditions commonly exists in real-world industrial environment, which heavily influence the performances of computer vision technologies, including object detection, object segmentation, etc. Current real-world captured datasets usually need the help of professional haze machines, which cannot handle all the conditions in real-world scenarios. 

To relieve the need of data captured in real-world industrial environment, we propose the IDS dataset which is captured in a more critical real-world quarry scenarios of industrial operations. 3300 real-world captured images are contained, where 3000 images are split for training and $300$ images are for testing. To the best of our knowledge, the IDS dataset is the first real-world dataset that captured in real-world industrial environment, which will be public available for research uses. 



The IDS Dataset is coming soon.
